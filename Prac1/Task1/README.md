# Task 1: Ship and Memento Simulation

This C++ program simulates ships and their mementos using a class hierarchy based on the provided UML design. It includes `Ship`, `CargoShip`, `MilitaryShip`, and memento classes for both `CargoShip` and `MilitaryShip`.

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Visual Studio Code (optional but recommended)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Yi-Rou1234/COS214_Prac1.git


2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

Navigate to the project directory that contains the C++ files.


3. **Open in Visual Studio Code:**

Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code (VSCode):


This step is optional but recommended for an integrated development environment.

4. **Build and Run:**

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` (or `Cmd+Shift+B` on macOS) in VSCode to trigger the build process. This compiles the C++ files and creates an executable named "main" in the project directory.

- Open the integrated terminal in VSCode (`` Ctrl+` ``) or use your system's terminal.

- Run the program by entering the following command and pressing Enter:

  ```
  ./main
  ```

- The program will execute and display output in the terminal.

## Program Overview

The program demonstrates the following:

- Creating `CargoShip` and `MilitaryShip` objects.
- Modifying ship properties.
- Using mementos to save and restore ship states.

## Files

- `ship.h`, `ship.cpp`: Defines the base `Ship` class.
- `cargoShip.h`, `cargoShip.cpp`: Defines the `CargoShip` class.
- `cargoMemento.h`, `cargoMemento.cpp`: Defines the `CargoMemento` class.
- `main.cpp`: Contains the main program logic for testing the classes.
